# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, which are configuration files for various software tools and applications. By keeping my dotfiles in a version control system like Git, I can easily synchronize and manage my configurations across different machines.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your home folder:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/balintapro/dotfiles.git
   ```

2. Change into the dotfiles directory:

   ```shell
   cd dotfiles
   ```

3. Run the installation script:
   - Files with folders should go into the `.config` folder under your home directory.
   - Files starting with `.` should go directly into your home directory.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and modify these dotfiles to suit your needs. Each file is named after the software or tool it configures, making it easy to find and customize specific settings.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions or improvements for my dotfiles, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I appreciate any contributions that can help make my configurations even better!
